/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Scenario: Test with a non-negative integer root. When Left() function is given a non-negative integer like 2, it should return a correct value following its formula, which is 5.

2. Scenario: Test with a zero integer root. When Left() function is given 0 as root, it should return 1.

3. Scenario: Test with a large integer root. Check if there is any overflow consideration in the function. If it is given a very large integer, the function should still able to return a correct result according to its formula or handle such overflow gracefully.

4. Scenario: Test with negative integer root. Although in the context of Heap, the root value should not be negative, however as a standalone function, if the root is given as a negative integer, it should still perform according to the mathematical formula or handle such cases.

5. Scenario: Test with multiple calls. Call Left() function several times with various numbers and it should consistently return correct results.

6. Scenario: Test with maximum integer limit of int. The system might give unexpected outputs for integer values that exceed the limit of int data type, thus those boundary cases should also be tested.

7. Scenario: Test with minimum integer limit of int. Similarly, the negative boundary limit also needs to be tested for any overflow situations.
