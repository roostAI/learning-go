Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Scenario 1: The root index passed to Right function is zero (0)
Expected: The function should return (0*2) + 2 = 2.

Scenario 2: The root index passed to Right function is a positive integer (for example, 3)
Expected: The function should return (3*2) + 2 = 8.

Scenario 3: The root index passed to Right function is a negative integer (for example, -3)
Expected: The function should return ((-3)*2) + 2 = -4.

Scenario 4: The root index passed to Right function is a very large number (for example, 1000000)
Expected: The function should work properly and return (1000000*2) + 2 = 2000002 without any memory overflow issues.

Scenario 5: The function is called multiple times simultaneously in a concurrent scenario
Expected: The function should work correctly in a multi-threaded scenario since it is stateless and does not depend on or modify any external variables.

Scenario 6: The root index passed to Right function is a decimal number (for example, 3.5)
Expected: As the data type for root is int, this would likely result in a compile error. If it is allowed to run, the outcome may be unpredictable as the function is not designed to handle floating point numbers.

Scenario 7: Try to pass a non-integer value such as a string
Expected: This should not compile as the function is defined to accept an int parameter.

Note: The lessons in this scenario will depend on the specifics of the type system and language specification.

	// NOTE: We don't test with decimal numbers or strings as this would not even compile.
	// Test case scenarios like these typically demonstrate the concept of static typing and
	// compile-time type checks. Depending on the situation, such a test might not add much value
	// as the language's type system would prevent the code from compiling.
