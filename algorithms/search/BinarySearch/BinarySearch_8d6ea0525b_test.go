/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test when the array `arr` is empty.
2. Test when the array `arr` has only one element and this element is equal to the `query`.
3. Test when the array `arr` has only one element and this element is not equal to the `query`.
4. Test when the array `arr` has multiple elements and the `query` is not present.
5. Test when the array `arr` has multiple elements, the `query` is present, and it is in the middle of the array.
6. Test when the array `arr` has multiple elements, the `query` is present, and it is at the beginning of the array.
7. Test when the array `arr` has multiple elements, the 'query' is present, and it is at the end of the array.
8. Test with a multielement array where elements are consecutive integers, both in ascending and descending order.
9. Test with a multielement array where elements are non-consecutive integers.
10. Test for the condition where all elements in the array are the same and equal to the `query`.
11. Test for the condition where all elements in the array are the same and different from the `query`.
12. Test when the array `arr` has both negative and positive integers.
13. Test when the array `arr` has multiple elements and multiple instances of the `query`.
14. Test when the array `arr` has multiple zeroes and the `query` is zero.
