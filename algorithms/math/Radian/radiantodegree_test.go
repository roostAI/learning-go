Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/Radian/radian_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestRadianToDegree]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The radianToDegree function may produce inaccurate results or overflow for very large radian inputs due to floating-point precision limitations.
Solution: Implement input validation to restrict radian values within a reasonable range, or use the math.Mod function to handle periodic nature of angles.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Potential loss of precision when converting between float64 types, which could lead to inaccurate results in angle calculations.
Solution: Consider using a higher precision numeric type like big.Float for critical angle calculations, or implement rounding to a specific decimal place.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test case, here are additional test scenarios for the `radianToDegree` function:

Scenario 1: Test Zero Radian Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts 0 radians to 0 degrees.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call radianToDegree(0).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the zero input correctly, which is a common edge case. It's important to verify that the function doesn't introduce any unexpected behavior for this simple input.

Scenario 2: Test Negative Radian Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles negative radian inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call radianToDegree(-math.Pi).
  Assert: Verify that the result is -180.
Validation:
  Testing negative inputs is crucial to ensure the function works correctly for all possible inputs. This test checks if the conversion is accurate for negative angles.

Scenario 3: Test Large Positive Radian Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts a large positive radian value to degrees.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call radianToDegree(10 * math.Pi).
  Assert: Verify that the result is close to 1800 (allowing for floating-point precision issues).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle larger inputs without loss of precision or overflow issues. It's important to test beyond the common range of 0 to 2π.

Scenario 4: Test Small Fractional Radian Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the accuracy of the function for small fractional radian inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call radianToDegree(math.Pi / 180).
  Assert: Verify that the result is close to 1 (allowing for floating-point precision issues).
Validation:
  Testing with small fractional inputs helps ensure the function maintains accuracy for fine-grained angle measurements. This is particularly important in applications requiring high precision.

Scenario 5: Test Radian Input Equivalent to 360 Degrees

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts 2π radians to 360 degrees.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call radianToDegree(2 * math.Pi).
  Assert: Verify that the result is close to 360 (allowing for floating-point precision issues).
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks a full rotation, which is a common use case in many applications. It also verifies that the function handles inputs at the upper end of a typical range correctly.

These scenarios, combined with the existing test case, provide a comprehensive set of tests for the `radianToDegree` function, covering various inputs including zero, negative values, large values, small fractional values, and full rotations.
