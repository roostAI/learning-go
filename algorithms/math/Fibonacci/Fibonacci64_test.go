Existing Test Information:

Test Cases:
    [TestFibonacci_3c2494e9fa]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: The fibonacci function may cause integer overflow for large input values, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the 'math/big' package to handle arbitrarily large integers, or implement input validation to limit the size of 'n'.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The function doesn't validate the input 'n', potentially allowing negative values which could lead to unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion.
Solution: Add input validation to ensure 'n' is non-negative, returning an error for invalid inputs.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios for the `fibonacci` function:

Scenario 1: Fibonacci of 1

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns the Fibonacci number for input 1, which is a special case at the beginning of the sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(1).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  The first Fibonacci number is defined as 1, so this test ensures the function handles this base case correctly.
  This test is important to verify the function's behavior for the smallest positive input.

Scenario 2: Fibonacci of a large number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to calculate Fibonacci numbers for larger inputs, testing its performance and accuracy for bigger numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large number, e.g., 30.
  Act: Call fibonacci(30).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 832040.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can handle larger inputs without overflow or performance issues.
  It's crucial to ensure the function works correctly for a wide range of inputs, including larger numbers that might be encountered in real-world scenarios.

Scenario 3: Fibonacci of 2

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior for the input 2, which is another special case in the Fibonacci sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  The Fibonacci number for 2 is 1, and this test ensures the function correctly handles this early case in the sequence.
  This test is important because it verifies the function's behavior at the point where the sequence starts to follow its characteristic pattern.

Scenario 4: Fibonacci of 20

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's accuracy for a medium-sized input, ensuring it correctly calculates Fibonacci numbers in the middle range.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(20).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 6765.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to calculate Fibonacci numbers accurately for inputs that are neither too small nor too large.
  It's important to have tests in the middle range to ensure consistent accuracy across different input sizes.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional cases and input ranges, helping to ensure comprehensive testing of the `fibonacci` function.
