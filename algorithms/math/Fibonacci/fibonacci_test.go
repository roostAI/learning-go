Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/Fibonacci/Fibonacci_3c2494e9fa_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestFibonacci_3c2494e9fa]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
Issue: The fibonacci function may overflow for large input values, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the math/big package to handle arbitrarily large integers, or implement bounds checking to prevent overflow.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: The function doesn't validate the input 'n', potentially causing issues with negative or excessively large values.
Solution: Add input validation to ensure 'n' is non-negative and within a reasonable range before processing.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios for the `fibonacci` function:

Scenario 1: Fibonacci of 1

Details:
  Description: Test the fibonacci function with input 1, which is a special case in the Fibonacci sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(1).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles the base case of 1, which should return 1 in the Fibonacci sequence. It's important to test this edge case as it's not covered by the general algorithm.

Scenario 2: Fibonacci of 20

Details:
  Description: Test the fibonacci function with a larger input to verify correct calculation for higher numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(20).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 6765.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle larger inputs correctly. It's important to test beyond small numbers to ensure the algorithm scales properly.

Scenario 3: Fibonacci of 2

Details:
  Description: Test the fibonacci function with input 2, which is another special case in the Fibonacci sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(2).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles the case of 2, which should return 1 in the Fibonacci sequence. It's important to test this case as it's the smallest input where the general algorithm starts to apply.

Scenario 4: Fibonacci of a large number

Details:
  Description: Test the fibonacci function with a very large input to check for potential overflow or performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call fibonacci(50).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 12586269025.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can handle very large inputs without overflowing or taking too long to compute. It's important to understand the limits of the function's implementation.

Scenario 5: Fibonacci of 1000000

Details:
  Description: Test the fibonacci function with an extremely large input to check for potential stack overflow or excessive computation time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a timeout mechanism if supported by the testing framework.
  Act: Call fibonacci(1000000).
  Assert: Verify that the function either returns a result within a reasonable time or that it doesn't cause a stack overflow.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior with an extremely large input. While it may not be practical to calculate such a large Fibonacci number, it's important to ensure the function doesn't crash or hang indefinitely.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional cases and exploring the function's behavior with various inputs, including edge cases and potential stress tests.
