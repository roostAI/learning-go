Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Test Scenarios:

1. Test with a positive number as input. This scenario would help to test if the function generates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.

2. Test with zero as the input. The program should return an array with zero as the first element.

3. Test with one as the input. The sequence returned should be [0, 1].

4. Test with a large number as the input. This would serve as a stress test to determine how performant the function is when the input size is large.

5. Test with negative numbers as the input. The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning an empty sequence.

6. Test with a non-integer input. Though Go's strict typing should prevent this from compiling, if the function were ever modified to accept different types, this test would be useful to ensure that it still behaves correctly.

7. Test when the input is maximum int value. This will test if the function can handle the highest possible input value.

8. Test how the function behaves with consecutive inputs. This helps to test if the function holds any state between invocations.

9. Test if repeated values from the Fibonacci sequence are correctly handled in the output sequence.

10. Test the output to ensure it matches the Fibonacci Sequence rules, i.e., each number should be the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

11. Validate the function call with no parameter value. This should ideally throw a compiler error.

12. Test with more than one integers as input. Again, it should throw a compiler error.

13. Test for the order of the output sequence. It should always be in an ascending order.
