================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The fibonacci function is potentially inefficient for large inputs, leading to excessive CPU usage and potential DoS
Solution: Implement memoization or an iterative approach to calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
Issue: Unchecked input to fibonacciSequence can lead to excessive memory allocation if num is very large
Solution: Implement input validation to limit the maximum value of num or use a fixed-size array instead of a slice

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the `fibonacciSequence` function:

Scenario 1: Test for a Large Input Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly generates a Fibonacci sequence for a large input number, ensuring it can handle larger computations without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large input number, such as 20.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with the large input number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice contains the correct Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th number.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can handle larger inputs without performance issues or numerical overflow problems. It validates the scalability of the implementation.

Scenario 2: Test for Input Number 1

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when given the input 1, which is a boundary case between the smallest valid input and zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the input number as 1.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with 1 as the argument.
  Assert: Check if the returned slice is [0, 1], which represents the correct Fibonacci sequence for n=1.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the function's behavior at the lower boundary of valid inputs, ensuring it correctly handles the transition from the base case to the general case.

Scenario 3: Test for a Very Large Input Number

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's behavior with an extremely large input, testing its limits and potential overflow scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a very large input number, such as 100 or more.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with this very large number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice with the correct number of elements and that the last few elements are correct (as calculating all elements might be computationally intensive).
Validation:
  This test is valuable for understanding the function's performance and accuracy limits. It helps identify potential issues with integer overflow or excessive memory usage for large inputs.

Scenario 4: Test for Consistency Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function produces consistent results when called multiple times with the same input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a moderate input number, like 10.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence multiple times (e.g., 3 times) with the same input.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return identical results.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is deterministic and doesn't have any hidden state or randomness that could affect its output across multiple invocations.

Scenario 5: Test for Memory Allocation

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function efficiently allocates memory, especially for larger inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a moderately large input number, such as 1000.
  Act: Measure memory usage before and after calling fibonacciSequence.
  Assert: Verify that memory usage increases linearly with the input size and doesn't exhibit unexpected growth.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the function's efficiency in terms of memory usage, which is particularly important for applications that might use this function frequently or with large inputs.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional aspects of the function's behavior, performance, and reliability. They help ensure comprehensive testing of the `fibonacciSequence` function across various use cases and potential edge conditions.
