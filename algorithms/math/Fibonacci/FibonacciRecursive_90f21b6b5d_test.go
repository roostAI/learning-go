/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Scenario: Testing for base case - `n` being equal to 0.
   Expected Result: The function should return 0, as Fibonacci number of 0 is 0.

2. Scenario: Testing for base case - `n` being equal to 1.
   Expected Result: The function should return 1, as Fibonacci number of 1 is 1.

3. Scenario: Testing where `n` equals 2.
   Expected Result: The function should return 1, as the second number in the Fibonacci series after 0 and 1 is 1.

4. Scenario: Testing where `n` equals 5.
   Expected Result: The function should return 5. Fibonacci series - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5

5. Scenario: Testing with a negative `n` value.
   Expected Result: The function should return the negative `n` value. This behavior isn't accurate per Fibonacci series, but reflects current logic.

6. Scenario: Testing where `n` equals 10.
   Expected Result: The function should return 55, as it is the 10th number in the Fibonacci series.

7. Scenario: Testing where `n` equals 20.
   Expected Result: The function should return 6765, as it is the 20th number in Fibonacci series.

8. Scenario: Stress testing with a large `n` value, such as 100.
   Expected Result: Note the function response time and see if it resolves within a reasonable period. This test will not validate the output but test the efficiency of the algorithm.

9. Scenario: Testing the function with an extremely large number which could potentially cause a stack overflow due to the recursive nature of the method.
   Expected Result: Observing how the function handles a StackOverflow scenario, and whether it provides a meaningful error message. Note that this test is likely to fail in a real situation.
