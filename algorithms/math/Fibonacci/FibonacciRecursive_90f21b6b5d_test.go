1. Check if the function returns the correct Fibonacci sequence value for a positive integer. For example, the 6th Fibonacci number is 8. So, when we pass 6 as the argument, the return value should be 8.

2. Validate the function with the lower limit. Input should be '1' and the output should be '1', because 1st number in Fibonacci series is '1'

3. Confirm that the function returns 0 when the input argument is 0, because 0 is the first number in Fibonacci series.

4. Validate the function with a large positive integer value. This will check if the function can handle larger arguments and still returns the right value.

5. Check if the function works correctly when called multiple times consecutively.

6. Test how the function handles negative numbers. According to your current implementation, it should just return the same negative number. However, Fibonacci sequence doesn't contain negative numbers, so you might want to raise a warning or an error in this case.

7. Validate the function with fractional number. Since Fibonacci sequence only hold for whole numbers, verify how the function behaves in this scenario. The function should ideally not accept these values.

8. Check how the function handles non-integer arguments such as strings or special characters. The function should either throw an error or not accept these values.

9. Test if the function returns errors or exceptions for unwanted inputs such as null or string variables.

10. Sanity Test, to verify if implementation of the Function has not impacted function execution flow and program execution completes successfully giving correct output.

	// TODO: The tests for fractional numbers and non-integers such as strings, special characters or null variables
	// would require a change in the signature of FibonacciRecursive function since it currently accepts and returns
	// only integers. Therefore, the function implementation is to be adapted to handle such cases. After adapting
	// the function, the corresponding test cases should be added here. Also, the function currently returns same
	// negative number, so the error or warning implementation is needed for handling negative numbers.
