================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
Issue: The FibonacciRecursive function uses unbounded recursion, potentially causing stack overflow for large input values
Solution: Implement an iterative version or use memoization to optimize the recursive approach and prevent stack overflow

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: Exponential time complexity of the recursive Fibonacci implementation can lead to denial of service for large inputs
Solution: Use dynamic programming or an iterative approach to achieve linear time complexity and prevent resource exhaustion

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios for the FibonacciRecursive function:

Scenario 1: Test Large Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci number for a larger input, testing the recursive nature of the function for deeper recursion levels.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large input value, such as 20.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive(20).
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected Fibonacci number for 20.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the recursive function handles deeper recursion correctly without stack overflow or performance issues. It's important to test larger inputs to verify the function's scalability.

Scenario 2: Test Input at Upper Boundary

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior at the upper limit of what it can handle before potential integer overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Determine the largest input that won't cause integer overflow (e.g., 46 for int32).
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with this upper boundary input.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is the correct Fibonacci number and hasn't overflowed.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for understanding the function's limitations and ensuring it behaves correctly at its upper boundary. It helps prevent unexpected behavior in production use.

Scenario 3: Test Performance with Memoization

Details:
  Description: This test compares the performance of the recursive function with and without memoization for a moderately large input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Implement a memoized version of the Fibonacci function.
  Act: Measure and compare the execution time of both functions for an input like 30.
  Assert: Verify that the memoized version is significantly faster while producing the same result.
Validation:
  While this doesn't directly test correctness, it's valuable for assessing the function's efficiency and potential for optimization. It can inform decisions about using the recursive approach in performance-critical scenarios.

Scenario 4: Test Consistency Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that repeated calls to the function with the same input produce consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a set of input values (e.g., 5, 10, 15).
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive multiple times for each input.
  Assert: Verify that all calls for the same input produce identical results.
Validation:
  This test checks for any potential side effects or state changes that might affect the function's output across multiple invocations, ensuring its reliability and predictability.

Scenario 5: Test Input Type Boundaries

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with inputs at the boundaries of the int type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare inputs at the minimum and maximum values of int.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with these boundary values.
  Assert: Verify that the function handles these extreme inputs gracefully, either by returning a valid result or handling potential errors.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's robustness when dealing with extreme input values, which is important for preventing unexpected crashes or incorrect results in edge cases.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional aspects of the FibonacciRecursive function's behavior, performance, and edge cases. They help ensure a more comprehensive testing strategy for the function.
