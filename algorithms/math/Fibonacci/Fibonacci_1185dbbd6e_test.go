Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is zero.
   Expected: Fibonacci number at position 0 is 0.

2. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is one.
   Expected: Fibonacci number at position 1 is 1.

3. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is two.
   Expected: Fibonacci number at position 2 is 1 (0+1).

4. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is five.
   Expected: Fibonacci number at position 5 is 5 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5).

5. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is seven.
   Expected: Fibonacci number at position 7 is 13 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).

6. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is ten.
   Expected: Fibonacci number at position 10 is 55 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55).

7. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is very large. This will help in testing the performance of the function.
   Expected: The function should be able to handle the large inputs and should output the Fibonacci number at that position.

8. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is negative.
   Expected: Since the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative integers, function should handle this case appropriately, perhaps by returning an error or predefined value.

9. Test scenario when the input number 'n' is a float or not an integer type.
   Expected: The function should appropriately handle invalid input types. It could return an error or default value.

10. Test scenario for the upper limit of the Fibonacci number that can be computed without causing an integer overflow. This pertains to the performance and robustness of the function.
    Expected: The function should not cause an integer overflow and should return the correct Fibonacci number or an error/optimal message if it's going beyond the permissible limit.
