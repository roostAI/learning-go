Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test with an input of 0:
  - Expect: The function should return 0 as the 0th Fibonacci number is 0.

2. Test with an input of 1:
  - Expect: The function should return 1 as the 1st Fibonacci number is 1.

3. Test with an input of 2:
  - Expect: The function should return 1 as the 2nd Fibonacci number is 1.

4. Test with an input of 3:
  - Expect: The function should return 2 as the 3rd Fibonacci number is 2.

5. Test with an input of 10:
  - Expect: The function should return 55 as the 10th Fibonacci number is 55.

6. Test with a large positive input number, such as 30:
  - Expect: The function should run without any crashes and should return the correct Fibonacci number.

7. Test with an input of negative integer:
  - Expect: The function should handle this gracefully. Because Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative integers, the function must handle or report the error appropriately.

8. Test with non-integer data types (like string, floats):
  - Expect: The function should handle this gracefully. The function needs to perform type check and return error if the input is not valid integer.

9. Load testing with a large sequence number 1000 (if the function is designed to handle such sequence).
  - Expect: Although the Fibonacci number may be very large for such case, the function should not crash or slow down drastically.

10. Test the function with concurrently running threads / requests (if itâ€™s supposed to be used in a concurrent environment).
  - Expect: The function should execute correctly in a concurrent environment, returning the correct results for each concurrent call.
