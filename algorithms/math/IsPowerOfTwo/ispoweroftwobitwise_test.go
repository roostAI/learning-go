================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: The function may not handle large positive integers correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or false positives for very large numbers.
Solution: Add a check for num > 0 && num <= math.MaxInt32 to ensure the input is within a safe range.

Vulnerability: Bitwise Operation Safety
Issue: While the bitwise operation is generally safe, it assumes 2's complement representation which may not be guaranteed on all systems.
Solution: Consider using a more explicit power-of-two check algorithm or add a comment explaining the assumption of 2's complement representation.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function:

Scenario 1: Test with a large power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a large number that is a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number that is a power of two (e.g., 2^30).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function works correctly for large powers of two, which is important for handling a wide range of inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a large non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a large number that is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number that is not a power of two (e.g., 2^30 + 1).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly distinguish between powers of two and non-powers of two for large numbers.

Scenario 3: Test with the maximum 32-bit integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with the maximum possible 32-bit integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the maximum 32-bit integer value (2^31 - 1).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with this value.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles edge cases at the upper limit of the integer range correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles negative numbers that would be powers of two if positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number that would be a power of two if positive (e.g., -8).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with this negative number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative inputs, even if they would be powers of two when positive.

Scenario 5: Test with the smallest positive non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies the smallest positive number that is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 3, which is the smallest positive integer that is not a power of two.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with 3.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles small non-powers of two, which is important for edge case handling.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional edge cases and important scenarios not already addressed in the provided test functions.
