Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Test Scenario 1: Input both positive integers
This test scenario checks that the function correctly calculates the modulus of two positive integers.

Test Scenario 2: Input both negative integers
This scenario checks that the function correctly calculates the modulus when both the input integers are negative. It's important because the function has a specific logic branch for this case.

Test Scenario 3: Input a negative integer and a positive integer
This scenario tests the function's ability to correctly calculate the modulus of a negative and a positive integer. It's interesting because the function has a specific logic branch for this case.

Test Scenario 4: Input a positive integer and a negative integer
This scenario aims to test how the function calculates the modulus of a positive and a negative integer.

Test Scenario 5: Zero as the second input
In this scenario, test what happens when the second input (denominator) is zero. Though in this function, explicit handling of zero denominator is given to avoid dividing by zero error.

Test Scenario 6: Zero as the first input
This scenario should validate that the function correctly calculates the modulus when the first input (the numerator) is zero and the other is a non-zero integer.

Test Scenario 7: Large input numbers
In this scenario, examine how the function handles large input numbers. This will test the function's efficiency and if it keeps precision.

Test Scenario 8: Small input numbers
This scenario tests how the function handles small input numbers, such as single digit numbers or small negative numbers.

Test Scenario 9: Modulus of identical numbers
This scenario would test what happens if both inputs are the same. This is interesting, as the mod of identical numbers should be zero.

Test Scenario 10: Real numbers as input
The function only accepts integer values. It would be interesting to test the function's behaviour with real numbers as inputs to ensure proper type handling.
