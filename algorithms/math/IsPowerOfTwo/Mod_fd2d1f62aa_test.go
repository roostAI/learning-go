Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Scenario: Both arguments are positive, with the second argument being larger than the first.
- Input: a=3, b=5
- Expected Output: 3

2. Scenario: Both arguments are positive, with the first argument being larger than the second argument.
- Input: a=7, b=4
- Expected Output: 3

3. Scenario: Both inputs are zero.
- Input: a=0, b=0
- Expected Output: 0

4. Scenario: The first argument is zero and the second is a positive number.
- Input: a=0, b=5
- Expected Output: 0

5. Scenario: The first argument is a negative number and the second is a positive number.
- Input: a=-7, b=4
- Expected Output: 1

6. Scenario: The first argument is a positive number and the second is a negative number.
- Input: a=7, b=-4
- Expected Output: -1

7. Scenario: Both arguments are negative, with the second argument being larger (or more negative) than the first.
- Input: a=-3, b=-5
- Expected Output: -3

8. Scenario: Both arguments are negative, with the first argument being larger (or more negative) than the second.
- Input: a=-7, b=-4
- Expected Output: -1

9. Scenario: The second argument is zero and the first is a positive number.
- Input: a=5, b=0
- Expected Output: 0

10. Scenario: The second argument is zero and the first is a negative number.
- Input: a=-5, b=0
- Expected Output: 0

Note: In the scenarios where the second argument is zero, the returned value is zero because division/modulo operation by zero is undefined. Therefore, these are special cases and should be handled carefully.
