Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Here are some test scenarios to be considered:

1. Test where `num` is a negative integer. The expected result should be `false` since only positive integers can be powers of two.
2. Test where `num` is zero. The expected result should be `false` as zero is not a power of two.
3. Test where `num` is one. The expected result should be `true` as one is the power of two to zero.
4. Test where `num` is two. The expected result should be `true` as two is the power of two to one.
5. Test where `num` is a number that is not a power of two (e.g. `num` is set to 3, 5, 6). The expected result should be `false`.
6. Test where `num` is a power of two more than two (e.g. `num` is set to 4, 8, 16, etc). The result should be `true`.
7. Test where `num` is a large number that is not a power of two. The expected result should be `false`.
8. Test where `num` is a large number that is a power of two. The result should be `true`.
9. Test where `num` is the maximum integer value. This would test the upper capabilities of the function and would depend on whether the maximum integer is a power of two.
10. Stress test with a sequence of multiple `num` inputs composing of both negative and positive integers, including zeroes and powers of two.
