================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The function may cause integer overflow for large positive inputs, leading to incorrect results or infinite loops.
Solution: Use uint instead of int for non-negative numbers, or add a check for num > 0 at the beginning of the function.

Vulnerability: Inefficient Algorithm
Issue: The current implementation has O(log n) time complexity, which is inefficient for large inputs and may lead to denial of service.
Solution: Use bitwise operations for a constant-time solution: return num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0

Vulnerability: Undefined Function
Issue: The 'mod' function is used but not defined, which will cause a compilation error.
Solution: Replace 'mod(num, 2)' with 'num % 2' to use Go's built-in modulo operator.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and requirements, here are some test scenarios for the `isPowerOfTwo` function:

Scenario 1: Test with a valid power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a number that is a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a number that is a power of two, such as 32.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(32).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies powers of two, which is its primary purpose. It's crucial for validating the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with a large power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies if the function can handle larger powers of two correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large power of two, such as 1048576 (2^20).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(1048576).
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle larger numbers, ensuring it doesn't break or produce incorrect results for bigger inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with a number slightly less than a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a number that is close to, but not quite, a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a number that is one less than a power of two, such as 31.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(31).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function doesn't incorrectly identify numbers that are close to powers of two, validating its precision.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior with negative input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a negative number, such as -4.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(-4).
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles negative inputs, which are not valid powers of two. It's important for error handling and input validation.

Scenario 5: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when given zero as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use 0 as the input.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case of zero, which is not considered a power of two.

Scenario 6: Test with a prime number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a prime number as not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a prime number, such as 17.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(17).
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to distinguish between powers of two and other types of numbers, particularly prime numbers which are not divisible by 2.

Scenario 7: Test with the maximum int value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with the maximum possible integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use math.MaxInt32 or math.MaxInt64 depending on the system.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(math.MaxInt64).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the upper limit of integer values without overflowing or producing incorrect results.

These scenarios cover a range of cases including normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions, providing a comprehensive test suite for the `isPowerOfTwo` function.
