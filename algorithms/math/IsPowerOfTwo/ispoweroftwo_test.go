================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: The function may not handle large input values correctly, potentially leading to integer overflow when dividing num by 2
Solution: Use uint64 instead of int to handle larger positive numbers, or add a check for num > 0 before processing

Vulnerability: Inefficient Algorithm
Issue: The current implementation has O(log n) time complexity, which could be exploited for denial of service with very large inputs
Solution: Implement a more efficient bitwise operation: return num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0

Vulnerability: Undefined Behavior
Issue: The mod function is not defined in the provided code, which could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior
Solution: Replace mod(num, 2) with num % 2, or properly define and implement the mod function

================================================================================
Based on the given function and requirements, here are some test scenarios for the `isPowerOfTwo` function:

Scenario 1: Test with a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a number that is a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a number that is a power of two, such as 32.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(32).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies 32 as a power of two. This test is important to ensure the basic functionality of the function for valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a number that is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number that is not a power of two, such as 24.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(24).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly identify numbers that are not powers of two, which is crucial for its accuracy.

Scenario 3: Test with the smallest power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the smallest power of two, which is 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 2.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(2).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly for the smallest valid input, which is a common edge case.

Scenario 4: Test with a large power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function works correctly with a large power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a large power of two, such as 1048576 (2^20).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(1048576).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can handle larger numbers without issues, ensuring it works across a wide range of valid inputs.

Scenario 5: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles zero, which is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 0.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for handling edge cases, as zero is a special case that should be correctly identified as not a power of two.

Scenario 6: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a negative number, such as -4.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(-4).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative inputs, which are not powers of two by definition.

Scenario 7: Test with the maximum integer value

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the maximum integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use math.MaxInt32 or math.MaxInt64 depending on the system.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwo(math.MaxInt64).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the maximum possible integer input without overflowing or producing incorrect results.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `isPowerOfTwo` function, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions. They test the function's behavior with powers of two, non-powers of two, special cases like zero and negative numbers, and extreme values.
