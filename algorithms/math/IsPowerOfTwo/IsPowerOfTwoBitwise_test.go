================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow
Issue: The function may produce incorrect results for very large positive integers due to potential overflow when calculating num - 1.
Solution: Use uint instead of int to handle non-negative integers, or add an explicit check for the maximum int value.

Vulnerability: Unhandled Edge Case
Issue: The function returns true for num=0, which is not technically a power of two and may lead to logical errors in calling code.
Solution: Add an explicit check to return false if num is 0 at the beginning of the function.

================================================================================
Based on the given function `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` and the existing test cases, I'll generate additional test scenarios that cover different aspects of the function. Here are the new test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Test with a large power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a large number that is a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number that is a power of two (e.g., 2^30).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function works correctly for large powers of two, which is important for handling a wide range of inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with a large non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a large number that is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number that is not a power of two (e.g., 2^30 + 1).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle large numbers that are not powers of two, preventing false positives for large inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with the maximum positive int32 value

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves with the maximum positive 32-bit integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the maximum positive int32 value (2^31 - 1).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with this value.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the upper limit of 32-bit integers correctly, which is important for preventing overflow issues.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles negative numbers that would be powers of two if positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number that would be a power of two if positive (e.g., -8).
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles negative inputs, even if they would be powers of two when positive, adhering to the function's specification.

Scenario 5: Test with the smallest positive power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies the smallest positive power of two (2).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 2.
  Act: Call isPowerOfTwoBitwise with 2.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the smallest positive power of two, which is a critical edge case for the algorithm.

These additional test scenarios complement the existing tests by covering more edge cases and potential problem areas, ensuring a more comprehensive test suite for the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function.
