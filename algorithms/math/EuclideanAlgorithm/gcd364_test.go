================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
Issue: The GCD function uses int type for parameters and calculations, which may lead to integer overflow for large input values, potentially causing incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the math/big package for arbitrary-precision arithmetic to handle large integers safely.

Vulnerability: Infinite Loop (CWE-835)
Issue: If both input parameters are zero, the function will enter an infinite loop, leading to resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
Solution: Add an input validation check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where both inputs are zero, returning an appropriate value or error.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the GCD function:

Scenario 1: Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with large numbers to ensure it can handle big integers without overflow or performance issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large integers.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these large numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct GCD for large numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the GCD function can handle large numbers correctly, which is important for applications dealing with big integer calculations.

Scenario 2: Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with negative numbers to ensure it handles them correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these negative numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct positive GCD.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the GCD function works correctly with negative inputs, as the mathematical definition of GCD is always positive.

Scenario 3: One Negative and One Positive Number

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with one negative and one positive number to ensure correct handling of mixed signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one negative and one positive integer.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct positive GCD.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles inputs with different signs, which is important for robust mathematical operations.

Scenario 4: Coprime Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with coprime numbers (numbers whose greatest common divisor is 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two coprime numbers.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these coprime numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies when two numbers have no common factors other than 1, which is a fundamental property in number theory.

Scenario 5: One Number is a Multiple of the Other

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function when one number is a multiple of the other.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers where one is a multiple of the other.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the smaller number.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles cases where one number completely divides the other, which is a common scenario in GCD calculations.

Scenario 6: Very Small Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with very small numbers, including 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare very small numbers, including 1.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these small numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct GCD.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function works correctly with small numbers and edge cases like 1, which are important for comprehensive coverage.

These scenarios complement the existing tests and provide a more comprehensive coverage of the GCD function's behavior across various input types and ranges.
