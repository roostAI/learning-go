================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Integer Overflow (CWE-190)
Issue: The GCD function uses int type for inputs and calculations, which may lead to integer overflow for large input values, potentially causing incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the math/big package for handling arbitrarily large integers, or add input validation to ensure inputs are within safe bounds for int type.

Vulnerability: Infinite Loop (CWE-835)
Issue: If both inputs are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop, as the condition 'b != 0' will always be true.
Solution: Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where both inputs are 0, returning 0 or an error as appropriate for the use case.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test cases, I'll generate additional test scenarios for the GCD function. Here are some new test scenarios that cover different aspects and edge cases:

Scenario 1: Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with large numbers to ensure it can handle big integers without overflow or precision issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large numbers that have a known GCD.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these large numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned GCD is correct for these large numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function works correctly with large inputs, which might be encountered in cryptographic applications or when dealing with very large datasets.

Scenario 2: Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the GCD function handles negative numbers correctly, returning a positive GCD.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative numbers with a known GCD.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these negative numbers.
  Assert: Check that the returned GCD is the positive absolute value of the expected GCD.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because the mathematical definition of GCD is always positive, even for negative inputs. It ensures the function adheres to this mathematical principle.

Scenario 3: One Positive and One Negative Number

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with one positive and one negative number to ensure correct handling of mixed signs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one positive and one negative number with a known GCD.
  Act: Call the GCD function with these numbers.
  Assert: Verify that the returned GCD is positive and correct.
Validation:
  This test covers a common real-world scenario where inputs might have different signs, ensuring the function behaves correctly in such cases.

Scenario 4: Very Small Numbers

Details:
  Description: Check the GCD function's behavior with very small positive numbers, including 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two very small positive numbers (e.g., 1 and 2).
  Act: Call the GCD function with these small numbers.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned GCD is correct (should be 1 in this case).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function works correctly at the lower bounds of positive integers, which is important for completeness and edge case handling.

Scenario 5: Identical Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function when both input numbers are identical.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number to use for both inputs.
  Act: Call the GCD function with the same number for both parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned GCD is equal to the input number.
Validation:
  This test checks a special case where the GCD should always be the number itself, ensuring the function handles this scenario correctly.

Scenario 6: One Number is a Multiple of the Other

Details:
  Description: Verify the GCD function's behavior when one input is a multiple of the other.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers where one is a multiple of the other (e.g., 15 and 45).
  Act: Call the GCD function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the returned GCD is equal to the smaller number.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly identifies when one number is a factor of the other, which is a common scenario in GCD calculations.

These additional test scenarios complement the existing tests and provide more comprehensive coverage of the GCD function's behavior across various input types and edge cases.
