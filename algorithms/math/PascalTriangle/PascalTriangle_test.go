Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/PascalTriangle/pascal_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsPascalTriangle]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The function doesn't validate the 'height' parameter, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation if a large value is provided.
Solution: Implement input validation to limit the maximum value of 'height' to a reasonable upper bound.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: Large 'height' values could cause integer overflow in slice allocation, leading to unexpected behavior or panics.
Solution: Add checks to ensure 'height' is within a safe range to prevent overflow in slice creation and arithmetic operations.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the `pascalTriangle` function:

Scenario 3: Pascal's Triangle with Zero Height

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when given a height of 0, which is an edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the edge case of zero height correctly. It's important to define the expected behavior for this input, as it's a valid integer input but doesn't produce a meaningful triangle.

Scenario 4: Pascal's Triangle with Negative Height

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when given a negative height, which is an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(-1).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice or handles the error appropriately.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles invalid inputs. It's crucial to ensure that the function doesn't panic or produce unexpected results with negative inputs.

Scenario 5: Pascal's Triangle with Large Height

Details:
  Description: Test the function's performance and correctness with a large height input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a large height value, e.g., 100.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(100).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a correctly structured triangle with the right number of rows and correct values.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle larger inputs correctly and efficiently. It's important to ensure that the function scales well and maintains accuracy for bigger triangles.

Scenario 6: Verify Symmetry of Pascal's Triangle

Details:
  Description: Test that the generated Pascal's Triangle is symmetrical for a given height.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a height, e.g., 10.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(10).
  Assert: For each row, verify that elements are symmetrical (first equals last, second equals second-to-last, etc.).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the fundamental property of Pascal's Triangle - symmetry - is maintained. It's a key characteristic that should be preserved regardless of the triangle's height.

Scenario 7: Verify Sum of Row Elements

Details:
  Description: Test that the sum of elements in each row is correct (should be 2^(row number)).
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a height, e.g., 8.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(8).
  Assert: For each row i, sum its elements and verify that the sum equals 2^i.
Validation:
  This test checks another fundamental property of Pascal's Triangle - that the sum of elements in each row follows a specific pattern. It ensures the correctness of the values generated.

These scenarios cover additional aspects of the `pascalTriangle` function, including edge cases, error handling, and mathematical properties of Pascal's Triangle. They complement the existing tests by exploring different dimensions of the function's behavior and correctness.
