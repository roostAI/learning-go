Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/PascalTriangle/pascal_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsPascalTriangle]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The function doesn't check if 'height' is negative or excessively large, potentially causing integer overflow in slice allocation
Solution: Add input validation to ensure 'height' is within a safe range, e.g., 0 <= height <= maxSafeHeight

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: Large 'height' values could lead to excessive memory allocation, potentially causing a denial of service
Solution: Implement a maximum allowed height and return an error for values exceeding this limit

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function doesn't handle potential panic scenarios from slice operations with invalid indices
Solution: Use defensive programming techniques, such as bounds checking, to prevent panics from occurring

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the `pascalTriangle` function:

Scenario 3: Pascal's Triangle with Height 0

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when given a height of 0, which is an edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(0)
  Assert: Check if the function returns an empty slice ([][]int{}).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles the edge case of zero height correctly. It's important to verify that the function doesn't produce any errors or unexpected results for this input.

Scenario 4: Pascal's Triangle with Negative Height

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when given a negative height, which is an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(-1)
  Assert: Check if the function returns an empty slice ([][]int{}) or handles the error appropriately.
Validation:
  This test verifies how the function handles invalid inputs. It's crucial to ensure the function doesn't panic or produce unexpected results for negative inputs.

Scenario 5: Pascal's Triangle with Large Height

Details:
  Description: Test the function's performance and correctness for a large height value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a large height value, e.g., 100.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(100)
  Assert: Check if the returned slice has the correct dimensions (100 rows) and if some known values in the triangle are correct (e.g., the last element of the last row should be 1).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle larger inputs correctly and efficiently. It helps ensure the function doesn't have performance issues or numerical overflow problems for bigger triangles.

Scenario 6: Verify Symmetry of Pascal's Triangle

Details:
  Description: Test if the generated Pascal's Triangle is symmetrical for a given height.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a height, e.g., 10.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(10)
  Assert: For each row, check if the elements are symmetrical (first equals last, second equals second-to-last, etc.).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the generated triangle maintains the symmetry property of Pascal's Triangle. It's an important mathematical property that should be preserved.

Scenario 7: Check Consecutive Row Relationships

Details:
  Description: Verify that each element in a row is the sum of the two elements above it in the previous row.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a height, e.g., 8.
  Act: Call pascalTriangle(8)
  Assert: For each element (except the first and last in each row), check if it's equal to the sum of the two elements above it in the previous row.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the fundamental property of Pascal's Triangle (each number being the sum of the two numbers directly above it) is maintained. It's crucial for ensuring the correctness of the triangle generation.

These scenarios cover additional edge cases, error handling, and mathematical properties of Pascal's Triangle that weren't addressed in the existing tests. They help ensure the robustness and correctness of the `pascalTriangle` function across various inputs and conditions.
