Test Cases:
    [TestSqrt]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: The Newton's method implementation may lead to division by zero if the derivative becomes zero, causing a runtime panic.
Solution: Implement a check for zero derivative in the newton function and handle it gracefully, e.g., by returning a default value or using an alternative method.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function may enter an infinite loop if the Newton's method doesn't converge, leading to resource exhaustion.
Solution: Implement a maximum iteration limit and return an approximation or error after reaching the limit.

Vulnerability: CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
Issue: Floating-point comparison for equality (cur-root != 0) is unreliable due to precision issues, potentially causing infinite loops.
Solution: Use an epsilon value for comparison, e.g., math.Abs(cur-root) < epsilon, where epsilon is a small value like 1e-9.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and requirements, here are several test scenarios for the `squareRoot` function:

Scenario 1: Positive Number Square Root

Details:
  Description: Test the square root calculation for a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive float64 number.
  Act: Call squareRoot with the prepared number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is the correct square root of the input.
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of the function works correctly for typical positive inputs. It's crucial for validating the basic operation of the square root calculation.

Scenario 2: Zero Input

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 value of 0.
  Act: Call squareRoot with 0.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 0.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's handling of the zero case, which is a specific edge case in square root calculations. It ensures the function correctly implements the mathematical definition of the square root of zero.

Scenario 3: Negative Number Input

Details:
  Description: Test the function's response to a negative number input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative float64 number.
  Act: Call squareRoot with the negative number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns -1.
Validation:
  This test validates the error handling for invalid inputs. It's important to ensure the function correctly identifies and responds to inputs outside its valid domain.

Scenario 4: Very Large Number

Details:
  Description: Test the function's accuracy with a very large positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a very large float64 number (e.g., 1e20).
  Act: Call squareRoot with the large number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value, when squared, is close to the input value within a small tolerance.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle large inputs accurately, which is important for ensuring numerical stability and precision across a wide range of inputs.

Scenario 5: Very Small Positive Number

Details:
  Description: Test the function's accuracy with a very small positive number close to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a very small positive float64 number (e.g., 1e-10).
  Act: Call squareRoot with the small number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value, when squared, is close to the input value within a small tolerance.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function maintains accuracy for inputs very close to zero, which can be challenging due to floating-point precision issues.

Scenario 6: Perfect Square

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a perfect square input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 number that is a perfect square (e.g., 16.0).
  Act: Call squareRoot with the perfect square.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is exactly the square root of the input.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can accurately calculate square roots for perfect squares, which should result in whole numbers without any floating-point imprecision.

Scenario 7: Irrational Square Root

Details:
  Description: Test the function's approximation of an irrational square root.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a float64 number that has an irrational square root (e.g., 2.0).
  Act: Call squareRoot with the number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value, when squared, is very close to the input value within a small tolerance.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can accurately approximate irrational square roots, which is important for handling a wide range of inputs that don't have exact rational square roots.

These scenarios cover a range of cases including normal operation, edge cases, and error handling, providing comprehensive test coverage for the `squareRoot` function.
