Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/SquareRoot/sqrt_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestSqrt]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide by Zero
Issue: The newton function is not shown, but if it involves division by (num - root^2), it could lead to a divide-by-zero error when root approaches the square root of num.
Solution: Implement a check in the newton function to prevent division by zero, or add a small epsilon value to the denominator.

Vulnerability: Infinite Loop
Issue: The loop condition 'cur-root != 0' may never be satisfied due to floating-point precision issues, potentially causing an infinite loop.
Solution: Use an epsilon value for comparison: 'math.Abs(cur-root) < epsilon' where epsilon is a small value like 1e-9.

Vulnerability: Precision Loss
Issue: Floating-point arithmetic may lead to precision loss, affecting the accuracy of the square root calculation.
Solution: Consider using the math.Sqrt() function for better precision and performance, or implement error bounds checking.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test case, here are additional test scenarios for the `squareRoot` function:

Scenario 1: Test with Zero Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles an input of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call squareRoot(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 0.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function handles the edge case of zero input correctly, as specified in the function implementation.

Scenario 2: Test with Negative Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns -1 for negative inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call squareRoot(-4).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns -1.
Validation:
  This test checks the error handling for invalid inputs, ensuring the function behaves as expected for negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test with Very Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's accuracy and performance with a very large input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call squareRoot(1000000).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a value close to 1000 (within a small epsilon for floating-point comparison).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large inputs accurately and efficiently.

Scenario 4: Test with Very Small Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's accuracy with a very small positive input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call squareRoot(0.0001).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a value close to 0.01 (within a small epsilon for floating-point comparison).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's precision for very small positive numbers.

Scenario 5: Test with Perfect Square Close to Float64 Max

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a very large perfect square number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a large perfect square close to but not exceeding float64 max value.
  Act: Call squareRoot with this large perfect square.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct square root.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle inputs close to the maximum float64 value without overflow or loss of precision.

Scenario 6: Test with Non-Perfect Square

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's accuracy for a non-perfect square input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call squareRoot(2).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a value close to âˆš2 (approximately 1.4142135623730951) within a small epsilon.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can accurately approximate square roots for non-perfect squares.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `squareRoot` function, including edge cases, error handling, and different ranges of input values. They complement the existing test case and provide a more comprehensive test suite for the function.
