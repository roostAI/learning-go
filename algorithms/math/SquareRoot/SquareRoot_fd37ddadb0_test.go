Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test Scenario: Positive Number
- Description: Pass a positive number to the squareRoot function, expect the returned result to be the square root of the input number.
- Input: 4
- Expected Output: 2

2. Test Scenario: Zero
- Description: Pass zero to the squareRoot function, expect the returned result to be zero as well since the square root of zero is zero.
- Input: 0
- Expected Output: 0

3. Test Scenario: Negative Number
- Description: Pass a negative number to the squareRoot function, expect the returned result to be -1 as the function should return -1 for negative input numbers.
- Input: -4
- Expected Output: -1

4. Test Scenario: Decimal Number
- Description: Pass a decimal number to the squareRoot function, expect the returned result to be the square root of the decimal input number.
- Input: 2.25
- Expected Output: 1.5

5. Test Scenario: Large Number
- Description: Pass a large number to the squareRoot function to test if it's able to handle large inputs without error.
- Input: 1000000
- Expected Output: 1000

6. Test Scenario: Non-number Value
- Description: Pass a non-number value (like a string or a boolean) to the function to test its error handling. (This could be excluded as Go is a statically typed language and the function interface itself prohibits such inputs.)

7. Test Scenario: Small decimal value
- Description: Test the function with a small decimal number to see if it handles precision correctly.
- Input: 0.0009
- Expected Output: 0.03

8. Test Scenario: Very large decimal
- Description: Test the function with a very large decimal number to see if it handles precision correctly.
- Input: 10000.25
- Expected Output: 100
