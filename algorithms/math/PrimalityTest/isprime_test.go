Test Cases:
    [TestIsPrimeNumberUsingSqrt]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-189: Numeric Errors
Issue: The function uses float64 for sqrt calculation, which may lead to precision errors for large integers, potentially causing incorrect primality results.
Solution: Use big.Int for large number operations or implement integer-based primality tests like Miller-Rabin for better accuracy and performance.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: For very large input numbers, the function may consume excessive CPU time, potentially leading to a denial of service.
Solution: Implement an upper bound check on the input number and consider using more efficient primality testing algorithms for large numbers.

Vulnerability: Inefficient Algorithm
Issue: The current implementation checks divisibility up to sqrt(num)-1, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
Solution: Modify the loop condition to 'i <= int(s)' to include the square root in the check, improving efficiency without compromising correctness.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and requirements, here are several test scenarios for the `isPrime` function:

Scenario 1: Test Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of known prime numbers.
  Act: Call isPrime() for each number in the list.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true for all these numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is true for each prime number. This test is crucial to ensure the core functionality of identifying prime numbers works correctly.

Scenario 2: Test Non-Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of known non-prime numbers (composite numbers).
  Act: Call isPrime() for each number in the list.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false for all these numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is false for each non-prime number. This test complements the prime number test and ensures the function can distinguish between prime and non-prime numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Edge Case - Number 2

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies 2 as a prime number, which is the smallest and only even prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrime(2).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is true for 2. This test is important because 2 is a special case as the only even prime number and the smallest prime number.

Scenario 4: Test Edge Case - Number 1

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies 1 as not a prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrime(1).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is false for 1. This test is crucial because 1 is often mistakenly considered prime, but by mathematical definition, it is not.

Scenario 5: Test Large Prime Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can correctly identify a large prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a known large prime number.
  Act: Call isPrime() with this large prime number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is true for the large prime number. This test is important to ensure the function works correctly for larger numbers and doesn't have performance issues.

Scenario 6: Test Large Non-Prime Number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a large non-prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a known large non-prime number.
  Act: Call isPrime() with this large non-prime number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is false for the large non-prime number. This test complements the large prime number test and ensures the function works correctly for larger numbers.

Scenario 7: Test Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles zero as a non-prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrime(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is false for 0. This test is important to ensure the function correctly handles edge cases, including non-positive integers.

Scenario 8: Test Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles negative numbers as non-prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of negative numbers.
  Act: Call isPrime() for each negative number.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false for all these numbers.
Validation:
  The assertion should check if the return value is false for each negative number. This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly handles input outside the domain of prime numbers.

These scenarios cover a wide range of cases including normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions, providing a comprehensive test suite for the isPrime function.
