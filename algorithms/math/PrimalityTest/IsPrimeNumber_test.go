Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/PrimalityTest/prime_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsPrimeNumber]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The function iterates up to 'num', potentially causing excessive CPU usage for large inputs, leading to denial of service.
Solution: Implement a more efficient primality test algorithm, such as the Miller-Rabin test, or limit the input size.

Vulnerability: Inefficient Algorithm
Issue: The current implementation checks divisibility up to 'num-1', which is unnecessary and inefficient.
Solution: Optimize by iterating only up to the square root of 'num' to reduce computational complexity: for i := 2; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(num))); i++

Vulnerability: Incorrect Prime Determination
Issue: The function incorrectly identifies 1 as a prime number, which is mathematically incorrect.
Solution: Add a check at the beginning of the function to return false if num <= 1.

Vulnerability: Unused Import
Issue: The 'math' package is imported but not used, which may lead to confusion or maintenance issues.
Solution: Remove the unused import or utilize it in the optimized square root calculation.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test case, here are additional test scenarios for the `isPrimeNumber` function:

Scenario 1: Test with the smallest prime number

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies 2 as the smallest prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(2)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test is important because 2 is a special case as the smallest and only even prime number. It ensures the function handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 2: Test with a large prime number

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can correctly identify a large prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large known prime number, e.g., 104729 (largest prime number under 1 million).
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(104729)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle large numbers and its efficiency in determining primality for bigger values.

Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: Check how the function handles zero, which is neither prime nor composite.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(0)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for handling edge cases. Zero is a special number that's neither prime nor composite, and the function should handle it correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with negative numbers, which are not considered prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose any negative number, e.g., -7.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(-7)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles negative inputs, which are not considered prime by definition.

Scenario 5: Test with a perfect square composite number

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies a perfect square composite number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a perfect square composite number, e.g., 25.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(25)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to identify composite numbers that are perfect squares, which can sometimes be tricky for primality tests.

Scenario 6: Test with a very large composite number

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with a very large composite number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a very large composite number, e.g., 1000000007 * 1000000009.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(1000000007 * 1000000009)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's performance and correctness for very large composite numbers, ensuring it doesn't incorrectly identify them as prime due to computational limitations.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `isPrimeNumber` function, including edge cases, special numbers, and performance considerations. They complement the existing test case by exploring additional scenarios not covered in the original test.
