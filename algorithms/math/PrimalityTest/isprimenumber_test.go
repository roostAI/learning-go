Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/PrimalityTest/prime_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsPrimeNumber]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
Issue: The isPrimeNumber function uses a naive algorithm that checks all numbers up to num-1, leading to poor performance for large inputs and potential DoS attacks.
Solution: Implement a more efficient primality test, such as the Miller-Rabin test, or optimize by checking only up to sqrt(num) and using early exit conditions.

Vulnerability: CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison
Issue: The function returns true for 1, which is not considered a prime number by mathematical definition.
Solution: Add a check at the beginning of the function to return false if num <= 1.

Vulnerability: Unhandled Error
Issue: The mod function is used but not defined in the provided code, which may lead to runtime errors if not properly implemented.
Solution: Define the mod function or replace it with the built-in modulo operator '%' to ensure correct behavior.

================================================================================
Based on the given function and the existing test case, I'll generate additional test scenarios that cover different aspects of the isPrimeNumber function. Here are the test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Test with the smallest prime number

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies 2 as a prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(2)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test is important because 2 is the smallest and only even prime number. It verifies that the function handles this special case correctly.

Scenario 2: Test with a large prime number

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can correctly identify a large prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large prime number, e.g., 104729 (the 10000th prime number).
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(104729)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle large prime numbers, ensuring it doesn't break or produce false negatives for bigger inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: Check how the function handles zero as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(0)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Zero is neither prime nor composite. This test ensures the function correctly handles this edge case.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with a negative input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a negative number, e.g., -7.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(-7)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Prime numbers are defined only for positive integers. This test ensures the function correctly handles negative inputs.

Scenario 5: Test with a perfect square

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies a perfect square as non-prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a perfect square, e.g., 25.
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(25)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function can correctly identify composite numbers that are perfect squares, which might be missed if the loop in the function is optimized incorrectly.

Scenario 6: Test with a large composite number

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a large composite number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large composite number, e.g., 104730 (104729 + 1).
  Act: Call isPrimeNumber(104730)
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large composite numbers without false positives, complementing the large prime number test.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the isPrimeNumber function, including edge cases and different types of inputs. They complement the existing test case by exploring additional scenarios not covered in the original test.
