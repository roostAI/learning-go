Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/PrimalityTest/prime_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsPrimeNumberUsingSqrt]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-189: Numeric Errors
Issue: The function uses float64 for sqrt calculation, which may lead to precision loss for large integers, potentially causing incorrect primality results.
Solution: Use integer-based primality test algorithms like Miller-Rabin for large numbers to avoid floating-point precision issues.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: For very large input numbers, the function may consume excessive CPU time, potentially leading to a denial of service.
Solution: Implement an upper bound check on the input number and consider using more efficient primality testing algorithms for large numbers.

Vulnerability: Inefficient Algorithm
Issue: The current implementation checks divisibility up to sqrt(num), which is inefficient for large numbers and may cause performance issues.
Solution: Optimize the algorithm by checking only odd numbers after 2 and implement early exit conditions to improve performance for large inputs.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test case, here are additional test scenarios for the `isPrime` function:

Scenario 1: Test with Zero

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies 0 as not prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrime(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Zero is not considered a prime number by definition. This test ensures the function handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 2: Test with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function handles negative numbers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a set of negative numbers (e.g., -1, -2, -7, -100).
  Act: Call isPrime() with each negative number.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false for all negative numbers.
Validation:
  Prime numbers are defined only for positive integers. This test ensures the function correctly handles negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with Large Prime Number

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a large prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large known prime number (e.g., 104729).
  Act: Call isPrime(104729).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle larger numbers and its efficiency in identifying primes.

Scenario 4: Test with Large Composite Number

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies a large composite number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large composite number (e.g., 104730 = 2 * 52365).
  Act: Call isPrime(104730).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can correctly identify composite numbers, even for larger values.

Scenario 5: Test with Edge Case: 2 (Smallest Prime)

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies 2 as prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrime(2).
  Assert: Check that the function returns true.
Validation:
  2 is the smallest and only even prime number. This test ensures the function handles this special case correctly.

Scenario 6: Test with Edge Case: 3 (Smallest Odd Prime)

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies 3 as prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call isPrime(3).
  Assert: Check that the function returns true.
Validation:
  3 is the smallest odd prime number. This test ensures the function correctly handles small odd primes.

Scenario 7: Test with Perfect Square Numbers

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly identifies perfect squares as non-prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of perfect squares (e.g., 4, 9, 16, 25, 36).
  Act: Call isPrime() with each perfect square.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false for all perfect squares (except 4, which is already covered).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles numbers that are on the boundary of its square root check.

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `isPrime` function, including edge cases, special numbers, and different ranges of inputs. They complement the existing test case and provide a more comprehensive test suite for the function.
