Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/SieveOfEratosthenes/sieveOfEratosthenes_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestSieveOfEratosthenes]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The function allocates a slice of size maxNumber+1 without bounds checking, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors for large inputs.
Solution: Implement input validation to limit maxNumber to a reasonable size, or use a more memory-efficient algorithm for larger numbers.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The calculation num * num may overflow for large values of num, leading to incorrect results or panics.
Solution: Use big.Int for large number calculations or implement overflow checks before multiplication.

Vulnerability: Inefficient Memory Usage
Issue: The isPrime slice is allocated with full size upfront, which may be wasteful for large maxNumber values.
Solution: Consider using a more memory-efficient data structure, such as a bit array or a map for tracking prime numbers.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios for the `sieveOfEratosthenes` function:

Scenario 1: Test with input 0

Details:
  Description: Check the function's behavior when given 0 as input, which is below the smallest prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles the edge case of 0 correctly, which is not a prime number and should result in no primes being returned.

Scenario 2: Test with input 1

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's output when given 1 as input, which is neither prime nor composite.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(1).
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles the special case of 1, which is not considered a prime number in mathematics.

Scenario 3: Test with a large prime number as input

Details:
  Description: Evaluate the function's performance and correctness with a large prime number as the upper limit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large prime number, e.g., 997.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(997).
  Assert: Verify that 997 is included in the returned slice and that all returned numbers are prime.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function works correctly for larger inputs and includes the input number if it's prime.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: Check the function's behavior when given a negative number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(-10).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function gracefully handles invalid inputs like negative numbers, which cannot be prime.

Scenario 5: Test for correctness of all primes up to a medium-sized number

Details:
  Description: Verify that all prime numbers up to a medium-sized number (e.g., 200) are correctly identified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of all prime numbers up to 200.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(200).
  Assert: Compare the returned slice with the prepared list of primes.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly identifies all prime numbers within a reasonable range, covering more cases than the existing tests.

Scenario 6: Test with input 2 (smallest prime number)

Details:
  Description: Check the function's output when given 2, the smallest prime number, as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(2).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice containing only [2].
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the edge case of the smallest prime number.

These additional test scenarios complement the existing tests by covering more edge cases, invalid inputs, and verifying the function's behavior across a wider range of inputs. They help ensure the robustness and correctness of the `sieveOfEratosthenes` function under various conditions.
