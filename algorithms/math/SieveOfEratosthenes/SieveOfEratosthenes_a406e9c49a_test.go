Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test with a "maxNumber" that is a negative integer. This is to test how your function handles an invalid range. Your function should return an empty result, or it may throw an error.

2. Test with "maxNumber" as 0. This scenario tests the lower boundary condition. Expected result, the function should return an empty array.

3. Test with "maxNumber" equal to 1. The function should handle this edge case by returning an empty array as 1 is not a prime number.

4. Test with "maxNumber" equal to 2. The function should return an array which contains 2 as this is the smallest possible prime.

5. Test with "maxNumber" as a prime number (e.g., 7, 13, 23). This tests that the function correctly identifies primes and includes the "maxNumber" itself if it is prime.

6. Test with "maxNumber" as a composite number (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 14). This tests that the function correctly identifies primes and does not include the "maxNumber" if it is not prime.

7. Test with "maxNumber" as a large number. This tests if your function can handle large numbers correctly and efficiently.

8. Test when "maxNumber" equal to `MaxInt`. The function should be able to handle the upper boundary of the integer data type.

9. Test parallel invocations of sieveOfEratosthenes function. This is to test if your function is thread-safe or not.

10. Run a random number generator to get "maxNumber" for testing. This test will help ensure your function can work with a variety of inputs.

11. In addition, you may also consider performance testing or stress testing depending on your requirements.
