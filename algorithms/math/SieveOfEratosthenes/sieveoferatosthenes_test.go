Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/math/SieveOfEratosthenes/sieveOfEratosthenes_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestSieveOfEratosthenes]

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The function may consume excessive memory for large input values, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors or denial of service
Solution: Implement input validation to limit maxNumber to a reasonable upper bound, or use a more memory-efficient algorithm for large inputs

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: Arithmetic operations like num * num and nextNum += num may overflow for large inputs, causing incorrect results or panics
Solution: Use big.Int for large number operations or implement checks to prevent overflow, e.g., if num > math.Sqrt(float64(maxNumber)) { break }

Vulnerability: Inefficient Memory Usage
Issue: Creating a boolean slice for all numbers up to maxNumber may be inefficient for large inputs
Solution: Consider using a more memory-efficient prime sieve algorithm, such as a segmented sieve or wheel factorization

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the `sieveOfEratosthenes` function:

Scenario 1: Test with input 0

Details:
  Description: Check the function's behavior when given 0 as input, which is an edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(0).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles the edge case of 0 correctly, which is not a valid input for prime number generation.

Scenario 2: Test with input 1

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's output when given 1 as input, another edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(1).
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles the case of 1, which is neither prime nor composite.

Scenario 3: Test with a large prime number as input

Details:
  Description: Evaluate the function's performance and correctness with a large prime number input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large prime number, e.g., 997.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(997).
  Assert: Verify that 997 is included in the returned slice and that all returned numbers are prime.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function works correctly for large inputs and includes the input number if it's prime.

Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: Check the function's behavior when given a negative number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement needed.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(-10).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function gracefully handles invalid negative inputs.

Scenario 5: Test for correctness of all primes up to a medium-sized number

Details:
  Description: Verify that all prime numbers up to a medium-sized number (e.g., 200) are correctly identified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of all prime numbers up to 200.
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(200).
  Assert: Compare the returned slice with the prepared list of primes.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly identifies all primes in a range, not just a subset.

Scenario 6: Test for absence of non-prime numbers

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function does not return any non-prime numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of known non-prime numbers (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20).
  Act: Call sieveOfEratosthenes(20).
  Assert: Verify that none of the numbers in the prepared list are present in the returned slice.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly excludes all non-prime numbers.

These additional scenarios cover edge cases, performance with larger numbers, handling of invalid inputs, and thorough verification of the function's correctness in identifying prime numbers.
