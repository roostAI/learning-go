Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test that the function returns the correct factorial value for a positive integer:
   Input: 5
   Expected Output: 120 (i.e., 5*4*3*2*1)

2. Test that the function returns 1 when the input is 0.
   This is because the factorial of zero is defined as 1.
   Input: 0
   Expected Output: 1 

3. Test that the function handles negative integers properly.
   As there's no standard factorial operation for negative values, the behaviour of the function in this case would depend on the specific implementation.
   Input: -3
   Expected Output: could vary depending on how the function is meant to behave with negative inputs.

4. Test that the function handles very large numbers correctly.
   Factorial growth is extremely rapid, causing the factorial of even fairly small numbers to quickly approach the limits of most integer types.
   Input: 20
   Expected Output: Depends on the numerical limits of the 'int' type in the specific environment - could return an overflow error.

5. Test that the function handles cases where the input is a non-integer, such as a string or a float.
   These situations would most likely result in a type error, unless the function implements some form of type-checking.
   Input: "three"
   Expected Output: Type Error or some exception based on the implementation.

6. Test for recursion stack overflow:
   If the input number is large enough, the recursive call might trigger a stack overflow error.
   Input: 1,000,000
   Expected Output: Runtime error (stack overflow)
