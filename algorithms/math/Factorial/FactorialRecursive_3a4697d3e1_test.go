Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test with a positive integer. For example, given input 5, the function should return 120 (factorial of 5).

2. Test with a negative integer. For example, given input -5, the function should keep multiplying the number by its next increment (for example, -5 * -4 * -3 * -2 * -1) until it reaches zero. However, because negative numbers don't have a factorial defined, this may possibility result in an infinite loop.

3. Test with zero. As per the factorial definition, FactorialRecursive function for zero input should return 1.

4. Test with big positive integer. This will test the limit of the function and if it's capable of calculating the factorial for large numbers without memory overflow.

5. Test with big negative integer. As per factorial definition, it should return an error if it's designed to handle such edge cases or fall into extended computations if not.

6. Test with real numbers. Factorial is not defined for real numbers. A correct behaviour is either to raise an error or return a value which signifies that operation was not successful.

7. Test with non integer numeric types, like float and double. These tests should check how the function is behaving with other numeric data types, as factorial function is not defined for non integer values.

8. Test for maximum int limit in GoLang. Golang int data type has a limit depending on the system (32bit: -2147483648 through 2147483647, and 64bit: -9223372036854775808 through 9223372036854775807) so a test case with an input greater than the max and less than the min should be constructed to see if the function can handle it or not.

9. Test for concurrency. Check if the function can handle multiple concurrent requests.

10. Test with null input. Check the function behaviour when no number is passed as input. It should either throw an error or default to a specific behaviour.
