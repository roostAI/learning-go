================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The factorial function may cause integer overflow for large input values, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the 'math/big' package to handle arbitrary-precision integers, or implement input validation to limit the size of 'num'.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: Large input values could lead to excessive CPU usage and potential denial of service.
Solution: Implement a maximum limit for the input value 'num' to prevent resource exhaustion.

================================================================================
Based on the provided Factorial function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios that could be considered:

Scenario 1: Test Factorial of a Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Factorial function can handle a larger input number correctly without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number that is within the range of int but large enough to test the function's limits.
  Act: Call Factorial with the large number.
  Assert: Compare the result with the pre-calculated factorial of that number.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can handle larger inputs without issues like integer overflow. It helps validate the function's performance and accuracy for more extreme cases.

Scenario 2: Test Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies how the Factorial function handles negative input, which is mathematically undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number as input.
  Act: Call Factorial with the negative number.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 1 (as per the existing test case) or handles it differently.
Validation:
  While mathematically undefined, it's important to test how the function behaves with invalid input. This test ensures consistent behavior and error handling for negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test Factorial of the Maximum Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when given the maximum possible integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use math.MaxInt32 or math.MaxInt64 depending on the system's integer size.
  Act: Call Factorial with the maximum integer value.
  Assert: Verify if the function handles this extreme case appropriately (e.g., returns an error, or a specific value).
Validation:
  This test is crucial for understanding how the function behaves at the upper limit of its input range. It helps identify potential overflow issues or other unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 4: Test Factorial Performance for Moderate Values

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the performance of the Factorial function for moderately large inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a slice of moderate-sized numbers (e.g., 15, 20, 25).
  Act: Call Factorial for each of these numbers and measure the execution time.
  Assert: Ensure that the execution time is within acceptable limits and that the results are correct.
Validation:
  Performance testing is important to ensure the function remains efficient for larger, but still reasonable, inputs. This helps in identifying any potential performance bottlenecks.

Scenario 5: Test Factorial Caching Behavior (if implemented)

Details:
  Description: If the Factorial function implements any caching mechanism, this test verifies its effectiveness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a sequence of repeated calls with the same input.
  Act: Call Factorial multiple times with the same number.
  Assert: Check if subsequent calls are faster than the first call, indicating successful caching.
Validation:
  If caching is implemented, this test ensures it's working correctly, improving performance for repeated calculations. If not implemented, this test could suggest a potential optimization.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional edge cases, performance considerations, and potential implementation details that weren't addressed in the original test suite.
