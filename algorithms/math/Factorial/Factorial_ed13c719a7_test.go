/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Scenario: Test the factorial function with positive numbers.
Expected: If I use the Factorial function on positive numbers, say 5, it is expected to produce the correct value, 120, as output.

2. Scenario: Test the factorial function with negative numbers.
Expected: Factorials do not exist for negative numbers. The program should handle this gracefully.

3. Scenario: Test the factorial function with a large number.
Expected: Large numbers should be handled efficiently without causing the program to crash, overload, or consume a large amount of memory.

4. Scenario: Test the factorial function with the number zero.
Expected: The factorial of zero is always 1, the function needs to return 1.

5. Scenario: Test the factorial function with extremely large numbers.
Expected: For extremely large numbers, even though the actual factorial would be a very large number, the function should not crash or slow down significantly.

6. Scenario: Test the factorial function with one.
Expected: The factorial of one is 1, the function needs to return 1.

7. Scenario: Test the factorial function with multiple similar numbers
Expected: Calling the function for similar numbers multiple times should produce the same result each time.

8. The scenario: Testing the factorial function using concurrent or multithreaded execution.
Expected: The function should perform the correct calculation and return the correct value even when executing concurrently or multithreaded scenarios.

9. Scenario: Call the factorial function without arguments.
Expected: When calling the function without an argument, it should provide an error or default behaviour.

10. Scenario: Test the factorial function with non-integer numbers.
Expected: Since factorial is undefined for non-integer numbers, the function should handle this appropriately, possibly with an error message.
