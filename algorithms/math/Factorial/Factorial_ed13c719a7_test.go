/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-sample using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Positive Test Scenario: Test the factorial function with a positive integer. For example, if the input is 5, the expected output would be 120 since 5*4*3*2*1 equals 120.

2. Zero Test Scenario: Test the Factorial function with 0 as an input. The expected output should be 1 according to the mathematical definition of 0 factorial.

3. Large Number Test Scenario: Test the Factorial function with a large number as an input to validate if the function can handle large inputs and does not result in overflow.

4. Negative Test Scenario: Test the Factorial function with a negative integer to ensure the function handles negative values correctly as factorial of a negative number is undefined.

5. Boundary Test Scenario: Test the Factorial function with the limits of the integer's range in GoLang to assure its behavior.

6. Efficiency Test Scenario: Test the runtime efficiency by timing the function's processing for large numbers to ensure the computation is handled in a reasonable amount of time.

7. Concurrency Test Scenario: Test the function in a concurrent situation to verify its thread-safety. For example, while executing multiple go routines which use this method concurrently.

8. Random Number Test Scenario: Run the function with a series of random integers and compare the results to a known correct implementation of the factorial.

9. Continuous Input Test Scenario: Test the function by passing a series of numbers in increasing order to ensure function integrity over repeated calls.

10. Reverse Order Test Scenario: Test the function by passing a list of numbers in decreasing order to validate if the order of input affects the results.

11. Repeated Input Test Scenario: Test the function by passing the same number multiple times and validate if consecutive calls with the same input produce the same results.
