================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The factorial function may overflow for large input values, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the 'math/big' package to handle arbitrarily large integers, or implement input validation to limit the maximum input value.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The function lacks input validation, potentially allowing excessive resource consumption for large inputs.
Solution: Implement input validation to restrict the maximum allowed input value, e.g., 'if num > 20 { return 0 // or handle error }'

================================================================================
Based on the provided Factorial function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios that could be considered:

Scenario 1: Test Factorial of a Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Factorial function can correctly calculate the factorial of a large number without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a large number that is within the range of int, such as 20.
  Act: Call Factorial(20).
  Assert: Compare the result with the expected factorial of 20.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function can handle larger inputs without causing integer overflow. It verifies the function's ability to work with bigger numbers, which might be required in certain applications.

Scenario 2: Test Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies how the Factorial function handles negative input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a negative number, such as -5.
  Act: Call Factorial(-5).
  Assert: Check if the function returns 1 (as per the existing test case for -1) or if it handles negative numbers differently.
Validation:
  While mathematically undefined, it's important to test how the function behaves with negative inputs to ensure consistent behavior and error handling.

Scenario 3: Test Factorial of the Maximum Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when given the maximum possible integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use math.MaxInt32 or math.MaxInt64 depending on the system's integer size.
  Act: Call Factorial(math.MaxInt32) or Factorial(math.MaxInt64).
  Assert: Verify if the function handles this extreme case gracefully (returns an error, panics, or returns a specific value).
Validation:
  Testing with the maximum integer value helps identify potential integer overflow issues and ensures the function has proper bounds checking.

Scenario 4: Test Factorial Performance for Medium-sized Input

Details:
  Description: This test measures the performance of the Factorial function for a medium-sized input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a medium-sized number, like 50.
  Act: Use Go's testing.B to benchmark Factorial(50).
  Assert: Ensure the function completes within an acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  Performance testing is crucial to ensure the function remains efficient for larger inputs, which could be important in certain applications.

Scenario 5: Test Factorial Consistency Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that multiple calls to the Factorial function with the same input produce consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number, such as 7.
  Act: Call Factorial(7) multiple times (e.g., 1000 times).
  Assert: Verify that all results are identical.
Validation:
  Consistency testing is important to ensure the function doesn't have any non-deterministic behavior, which could lead to unreliable results in production.

These scenarios cover additional aspects of the Factorial function, including performance, consistency, and edge cases, complementing the existing test cases you've provided.
