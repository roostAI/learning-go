================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The factorial function may overflow for large input values, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
Solution: Use big.Int from the 'math/big' package to handle arbitrarily large integers, or implement input validation to limit the maximum allowed input value.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: The function lacks input validation, potentially allowing excessive resource consumption for large inputs.
Solution: Implement input validation to restrict the maximum allowed input value, e.g., 'if num > 20 { return 0 // or handle error }' at the beginning of the function.

================================================================================
Based on the provided function and the existing test cases, here are additional test scenarios for the Factorial function:

Scenario 1: Test Factorial of a Large Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Factorial function can handle a larger input number correctly without overflowing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number within the int range.
  Act: Call Factorial with the large number.
  Assert: Verify that the result matches the expected factorial of the large number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle larger inputs without issues, which is important for real-world applications where larger factorials might be needed.

Scenario 2: Test Factorial of a Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies how the Factorial function handles negative input, which is not a valid input for factorial calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number.
  Act: Call Factorial with the negative number.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 1 (as per the existing test case) or handles it differently.
Validation:
  While mathematically undefined, it's important to test how the function behaves with invalid inputs to ensure consistent behavior and error handling.

Scenario 3: Test Factorial of the Maximum Integer Value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when given the maximum possible integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the maximum value for int in Go.
  Act: Call Factorial with math.MaxInt32 or math.MaxInt64 (depending on the system).
  Assert: Verify if the function handles this extreme case appropriately (e.g., returns an error, panics, or returns a specific value).
Validation:
  Testing with extreme values helps identify potential overflow issues and ensures the function's robustness in edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test Factorial Performance for Moderate Values

Details:
  Description: This test measures the performance of the Factorial function for moderately large inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a moderate number (e.g., 20).
  Act: Use Go's benchmarking tools to measure the performance of multiple calls to Factorial.
  Assert: Ensure the function completes within an acceptable time frame.
Validation:
  Performance testing is crucial to ensure the function remains efficient for larger, but still reasonable, inputs.

Scenario 5: Test Factorial Consistency Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that repeated calls to Factorial with the same input produce consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number (e.g., 7).
  Act: Call Factorial multiple times with the same input.
  Assert: Verify that all calls return the same result.
Validation:
  Consistency across multiple calls is important for the reliability of the function, especially in concurrent or repeated use scenarios.

These scenarios complement the existing tests by covering additional aspects of the Factorial function's behavior, performance, and edge cases.
