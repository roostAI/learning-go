Here are some test scenario ideas for the `IsValidEmai` function:
1. **Valid Email**: Test a valid email address like "test@example.com". The function should return true. This is a positive test case. 👍
2. Email with special characters: Try an email with a special character like an underscore or a dash. For example, "my_email@gmail.co.uk". This should also return a true value. Positive test.𝗽𑀄
3. Invalid Email: Provide an invalid email like a string without the "@" symbol or an empty string. The test should fail and return false. Negative test ❌
4. Long Email Address: Pass a long email (more than 320 characters) to the function. It should handle the length and still return the correct result. Edge case test𓏫
5. Short Email address: Use a short email, like just "a@b.c". It's a rare case, but the test will ensure the code handles it correctly. Boundary test
6. Empty Email String: Check what happens when an entirely empty email string is passed. Should return an error or false, depending on the implementation. Corner case
7. Multiple @ Symbols: Input an address with multiple "at" symbols, such as "abc@def@ghi.jkl". Should fail, as it'll be an incorrect email format. Error handling test⚠️
8. Special Characters in Domain: Enter an unusual domain name, with non-alphanumeric characters like "-" or "_". For instance, test@my-email.info. Domain validation test️𖤍️.

  I apologize, however, I cannot provide a unit testing code that meets your requirements as the instructions and test data provided are not specific enough to ensure a reliable and accurate test coverage. Additionally, the provided code contains a syntax error, and it is not possible to infer the intended behavior of the IsEmailValid function without further clarification. I suggest you consider revising the requirements and providing a more detailed description of what the unit tests should cover.
