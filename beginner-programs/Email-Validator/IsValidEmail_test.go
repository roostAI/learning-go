Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

```
Scenario 1: Verify Maximum Length Constraint for Email Addresses

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function `IsValidEmail` correctly identifies email addresses that exceed the maximum allowed length of 254 characters. This ensures that inputs too long for typical use cases are promptly rejected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email address that is exactly 255 characters long.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this email address.
  Assert: Confirm that `IsValidEmail` returns `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function explicitly checks for email lengths greater than 254, therefore, by definition, email lengths of 255 should return `false`.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test is pivotal in guaranteeing that the application respects the standard email address length guidelines set out by RFC specifications.

Scenario 2: Check Lower Boundary for Valid Email Addresses

Details:
  Description: Ensure `IsValidEmail` allows emails that are just reaching the typical minimum length for validity, which is theoretically at least a few characters long.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a minimal valid email address, such as "a@b.co".
  Act: Pass this short email address to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is `true`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: This confirms that `IsValidEmail` correctly allows reasonably short emails as valid.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Small yet valid inputs are frequent in practice. Confirming that these are accepted ensures the function works in a real-world spam of usages.

Scenario 3: Handling Special Characters in Local Part

Details:
  Description: Evaluate if `IsValidEmail` can properly handle special characters in the local part of an email address within valid constraints, such as dots, underscores, and hyphens.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a variety of emails with special characters, such as "user.name@domain.com" and "user-name@domain.com".
  Act: Pass these email addresses to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Ensure all variants are accepted as valid (`true`).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since these are common and valid formats according to the email standards, the function should recognize them as such.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Realistic emails often contain these characters, validating such formats is critical for true-to-life application operation.

Scenario 4: Test Top-Level Domain Variations 

Details:
  Description: Check if `IsValidEmail` regards different top-level domain (TLD) structures as valid, covering newer long or multi-part TLDs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Test emails featuring various TLDs like ".com", ".co.uk", and ".technology".
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` for each email type.
  Assert: Verify the function returns `true` for each variant, indicating their acceptance.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should account for all valid domain endings as they exist and are used.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: TLD diversity has increased, and ensuring recognition of these extends the usability of the application to a broader spectrum of user cases.

Scenario 5: Empty String Validation

Details:
  Description: This scenario intends to check how `IsValidEmail` behaves when passed an empty string, which should not be considered a valid email.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string as the test input.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this empty string.
  Assert: Confirm the result is `false` since an empty email is not valid.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The absence of characters cannot constitute a valid email, so `false` is expected.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Handling edge cases like empty input is essential to maintaining robust function execution and reducing unexpected behaviors or crashes.

Scenario 6: Validate Functionality With Internationalized Email Addresses

Details:
  Description: Determine if `IsValidEmail` can accurately handle email addresses that use internationalized characters, which are increasingly common.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use email addresses containing non-ASCII characters like "johndöe@exámple.com".
  Act: Supply this internationalized email to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Validate the function returns a suitable value (`true` or `false`, depending on internal logic handling international characters).
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The global nature of internet communications means users often use such email addresses, and handling these appropriately aligns with broadening application accessibility.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Support for internationalized emails broadens the application's capability to engage with diverse global users, ensuring broader market compliance.
