Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Below are the test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function from the "Validator" package, utilizing the Go testing structure as per your instructions.

**Scenario 1: Validate a typical email address**

Details:
- Description: Test with a standard email address format, including a valid domain and user name.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare a string that represents a common email pattern, such as "user@example.com".
  - Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  - Assert: Expect the function to return `true`, indicating the email is valid.
- Validation:
  - The assertion checks if the function properly identifies standard email formats as valid. This test confirms that the function adheres to common email validation rules, supporting regular use cases.

**Scenario 2: Test for email length exceeding the maximum limit**

Details:
- Description: Verify that emails exceeding the 254-character limit are considered invalid.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Construct an email string where the total length exceeds 254 characters.
  - Act: Pass this email to `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Expect the function to return `false` due to the length constraint.
- Validation:
  - This scenario ensures that the function correctly enforces the maximum length restriction for emails, protecting against buffer overflow issues and maintaining compliance with email standards.

**Scenario 3: Validate an empty email string**

Details:
- Description: Determine how the function handles an empty input string.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Utilize an empty string as the test email.
  - Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with this input.
  - Assert: The expected result is `false`, as an email cannot be empty.
- Validation:
  - This test ensures the function properly manages edge cases where no email is provided, ensuring robustness against invalid inputs.

**Scenario 4: Check email with missing "@" character**

Details:
- Description: Validate function behavior when the "@" symbol, a crucial part of email formatting, is absent.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Craft an email without the "@" symbol, e.g., "useratexample.com".
  - Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this malformed email.
  - Assert: Verify the return value is `false`.
- Validation:
  - Such tests are crucial to ensure that the function appropriately identifies formatting errors, maintaining strict email validation standards.

**Scenario 5: Test email with multiple "@" characters**

Details:
- Description: Evaluate how the function treats emails with multiple "@" symbols.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Formulate an email string such as "user@@example.com".
  - Act: Pass this email to the function.
  - Assert: The expected output should be `false` due to multiple "@" symbols violating email syntax.
- Validation:
  - Testing with incorrectly formatted emails helps to assure that the function will reject incorrect usage, which is important for filtering invalid input.

**Scenario 6: Validate an email with non-ASCII characters**

Details:
- Description: Ensure that the function can correctly handle non-ASCII characters within the email.
- Execution:
  - Arrange: Use a test case featuring an accent, like "user@exámple.com".
  - Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this input.
  - Assert: Depending on the intended flexibility of the function, the return should be `false`, suggesting that it is restrictive about ASCII characters only.
- Validation:
  - This test helps determine if the function accommodates internationalization or restricts to basic ASCII, reflecting its robustness and versatility.

These scenarios collectively assess the email validation function by addressing a spectrum of test cases, from common to edge conditions, thus enhancing its functionality verification.
